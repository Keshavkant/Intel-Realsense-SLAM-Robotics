# Intel-Realsense-SLAM-Robotics
Intel-Realsense-SLAM-Robotics is a repository for logging all RnD work being done by me and Soceity of Robotics and Automation (SRA) - VJTI to explore SLAM robotics on Intel Realsense cameras. Currently our research is focused on leveraging Intel Realsense Depth Camera 
D435i to build an autonomous quadruped robot.
